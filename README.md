# Spatial Arrangement in Video Conferencing, Group 8
#### Robin Schmidiger, Pascal Strebel, Lukas Stefan Heinz Hasler, Cedric Weibel

As opposed to physical meetings or gatherings, participants do not have a spatial location relative to each other, i.e., there is only one “sound source” for 
all speakers. This does not necessarily scale well. Especially in larger gatherings, people cannot naturally form groups by walking up to each other and start talking without disturbing the whole meeting. 
How can this be mimicked in online meetings instead of artificial concepts like break-out rooms, but without making it too complex or “playful”?

## Project description and user needs
(Week 2-3)

We used the following questions as guidelines for our interviews: [Interview Questions](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Interview_Needfinding_Questions.pdf)

    TODO
    
    https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjg1ZWo=/
    
Add a description of your project, based on your needfinding and brainstorming. Minimum answer the following questions: 
- What are the problem the users are facing?
- What are the goals of the project?

Include notes from your interviews and document your needfinding process 

## Ideation
(Weeks 2-4)

    TODO
    PPT
    https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ptLie0YxKRN8-z80uJLtywzf_cpD9aaw7GOBeu8HHJY/edit?usp=sharing
    Personas

    Affinity Diagram
    https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjg1ZWo=/
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users.  
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.  
Add a link to your [Miro Whiteboard](https://www.miro.com)  
Upload the PPT presentation to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.  
Optional: in this part you can document ideation and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. )  
    
## Evaluation
(Weeks 5-7)

    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion.  
Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas  

## Prototype
(Weeks 8-14)

    TODO
Describe your high-fidelity manual prototype.  
Describe your high fideltiy automatic prototype to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.  
Create and upload a video "deliverables" folder of your final prototype (which will be used in the final presentation) and include the link here.  
In the code folder, document the readme file with build / run instructions.
