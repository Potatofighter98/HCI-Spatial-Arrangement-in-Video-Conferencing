# Spatial Arrangement in Video Conferencing, Group 8
#### Robin Schmidiger, Pascal Strebel, Lukas Stefan Heinz Hasler, Cedric Weibel

As opposed to physical meetings or gatherings, participants do not have a spatial location relative to each other in video calls, i.e., there is only one “sound source” for 
all speakers. This does not necessarily scale well. Especially in larger gatherings, people cannot naturally form groups by walking up to each other and start talking without disturbing the whole meeting. 
How can this be mimicked in online meetings instead of artificial concepts like break-out rooms, but without making it too complex or “playful”?

## Project description and user needs
(Week 2-3)

Ater a first brainstorming phase, we came up with [Several Questions](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Interview_Needfinding_Questions.pdf) as guidelines for our interviews. Each of us conducted two to three such interviews (protocols can be found here: [Protocols Cedric](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Interviewprotokolle_Cedric.pdf), [Protocols Lukas](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Interviewprotokolle_Lukas.pdf), [Protocols Pascal](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Interviewprotokolle_Pascal.pdf), [Protocols Robin](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Interviewprotokolle_Robin.pdf)).      

## Ideation
(Weeks 2-4)

The interviews resulted in a [Final List of Needs](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Needfinding%20Final.pdf) both for every interviewee and also accross all interviewees.

These can be summed up:
- Many users only use one tool that they know. Generally speaking, it is hard for them to get used to a new tool with new features. They prefer minimal effort.
- It would be beneficial if the tool would look exactly the same on all possible devices.
- Features should not be hidden.
- In terms of the layout, less is often more. There should not be too much info on the screen at once to not overwhelm the basic user.
- Audio is definitely more important than video.
- Facial expressions and reactions are an important part of an online conversation. Some users want the facecam to be always visible, whereas size and placement should be up to the the individual user.
- Sharing multiple screens at the same time would be appreciated mostly by business and student users alike.
- There should be a siimple function for data exchange.
- Bilateral talks between "seatmates" do not really seem to be appreciated over all interviewees. Not being distracted was often viewed as a good thing. A simple text chat would be sufficient.
- In some interviews, the wish to be able to mute individuals came up.
- Many users are kind of lost when they are put into breakout rooms.
- Depending on their job in a video call, numerous users would like to have clear permissions.
- Within bigger groups, a clear hierarchy should be established, where each user is assigned to a different priority.
- Especially student users would like an improved "rasing hand" tool since the host does not always notices an answer.

As a takeaway, our most important **insights** were the following:
- Most interviewees prefer a simple UI
- The arrangement of participants should be up to the user in some way
- Screen Sharing & File Sharing should be easier and support additional features
- There should be a better permission/role system within a call

Based on these interview outcomes, we created our [Affinity Diagram](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-hci2020-group-08/blob/2020/Deliverables/Affinity_Diagram.png) (which can also be found on https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjg1ZWo=/). We will aim on creating an UI that is as beneficial as possible in meet one or multiple of these needs.

    Affinity Diagram
    https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjg1ZWo=/
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users.  
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.  
Add a link to your [Miro Whiteboard](https://www.miro.com)  
Upload the PPT presentation to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.  
Optional: in this part you can document ideation and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. )  
    
## Evaluation
(Weeks 5-7)

    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion.  
Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas  

## Prototype
(Weeks 8-14)

    TODO
Describe your high-fidelity manual prototype.  
Describe your high fideltiy automatic prototype to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.  
Create and upload a video "deliverables" folder of your final prototype (which will be used in the final presentation) and include the link here.  
In the code folder, document the readme file with build / run instructions.
